# Solana Programming Challenge Solutions — Blueshift Learn

Welcome to my personal repository for the [Blueshift Learn](https://learn.blueshift.gg/zh-CN/challenges) Solana programming challenges. This is a curated, open-source collection of my solutions and learning notes, created to document my journey and help other developers in the Solana ecosystem.

## About the Blueshift Challenges

[Blueshift Learn](https://learn.blueshift.gg/zh-CN/challenges) provides a structured, hands-on path for mastering Solana development. The challenges cover a wide range of topics and frameworks, rewarding successful completion with NFTs. Based on the platform, the tracks include:

*   **TypeScript**: Beginner-friendly tasks like minting SPL tokens.
*   **Anchor Framework**: Projects from beginner (Vault, Escrow) to intermediate (Flash Loan) levels.
*   **Rust (Pinocchio)**: Intermediate to advanced on-chain programs (Vault, Escrow, Secp256r1 Vault, Flash Loan, Quantum Vault, AMM).
*   **Assembly**: Intermediate to advanced challenges (Memo, Timeout, Slippage).

Each challenge is designed to test and solidify practical skills in writing secure, efficient, and production-ready Solana programs.

## Repository Purpose & Structure

This repo serves two main goals:

1.  **My Learning Log**: A public record of my progress through the Blueshift curriculum.
2.  **Community Resource**: Clean, well-documented example solutions to complement the official challenges.

The repository is organized by the primary technology/framework:
